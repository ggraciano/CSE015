# CSE015 - Descrete Mathenmatics

This repository contains a project designed to explore the part of mathematics devoted to the study of discrete, as opposed to continuous, objects such as integers, steps taken by a computer program, distinct paths to travel from point A to point B on a map along a road network, and ways to pick a winning set of numbers in a lottery. Written in Python, the project corresponds with the following task:
