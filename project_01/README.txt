Project Title:
Bonus Python Homework

Getting Started:
The goal of this assignment is to implement the topics discussed in this course 
into python code. The code used to complete such assignment is based off of 
Python 3.x, that is, the present and future of the language. As such, the following 
code abides by the rules for syntax of Python 3.x.

Description:
1:	 Functions for all logical operators are implemented and tested in this section, 
	 where 'p' and 'q' represent the arguments to be passed to the function called.
1.1: AND(p, q) returns the result of the logical conjunction between the two 
	 arguments.
1.2: OR(p, q) returns the result of the logical disjunction between the two 
	 arguments.
1.3: IF(p, q) returns the result of the material implication between the two 
	 arguments.
1.4: Not(p) returns the result of the negation of the argument.
1.5: IFF(p, q) returns the result of the material equivalence between the two 
	 arguments.
1.6: evaluate(formula) makes a call to the appropriate function called and returns 
	 the logical operation of the two arguments.

2.	 The Cartesian product of the two sets, that is, 'x' and 'y', is calculated 
	 when cartesianProduct(x, y) is called.
3.	 Given two sorted lists, that is, 'list1' and 'list2', merge(list1, list2) 
	 merges both of the lists together into a single sorted list.
4.	 Euclid's Algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor of two integers, 
	 that is, 'a' and 'b', is calculated when gcd(a, b) is called.
